# 90s-CPU

Hello there!ðŸ‘‹

Devin here; This repository holds my code for a project from an Assembly and Computer Architecture course I took at University.

**Overarching Project Goal**
These classes form an elemental example of the software behind 90s computer architecture. The machine I've built takes a BASIC-based assembly language as input; Said input is lexed, parsed, and semantically analyzed prior to being converted to binary and sent to execution.


**Running the Code**
Input: Assembly language on file written in a variant of BASIC
Intermediary: -> Lexical Analysis -> Binary Stream -> Executable ->
Output: Execute 

To Run:
- use terminal, go to directory CPU
  - javac *.java
  - java Driver
  
The program will read from the asssembly file adn execute accordingly.
